# Prelude

I figured I've never really tried making a blog before, so why not try now? IPFS is too slow, so as of the time of writing, this blog is currently hosted via GitHub Pages, it uses the Hugo SSE and the source code can be found here: at [github.com/zevynet/zevynet](https://github.com/zevynet/zevynet)
